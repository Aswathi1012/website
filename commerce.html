                Commerce is the exchange of goods and services, especially on a large scale.[1] It includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological systems that operate in a country or in international trade.

                In the economic sense, "commerce" refers to the conduct of trade among economic agents. Commerce generally affects the well-being and welfare of citizens and residents, as it is known[by whom?] to directly impact the money which people have and their job opportunities as well. The term "commerce" may also refer to the buying and selling of commodities globally or across borders - between governments and between business firms.
